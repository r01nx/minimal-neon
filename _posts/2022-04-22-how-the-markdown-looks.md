Text can be **bold**, _italic_, ~~strikethrough~~ or `keyword`.

[Link to another page](./about.md).

There should be whitespace between paragraphs.

If there isn't then I have messed it up again!

# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others roast each other's code from anywhere.

## Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.
>
> When something is important enough, ask others to help you because you will probably mess it up!

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

#### Header 4

*   This is an unordered list following a header.
*   This is an unordered list following a header.
*   This is still an unordered list following a header.

##### Header 5

1.  This is an ordered list following a header.
2.  I don't know why I waste time like this.
3.  This is an ordered list following a header.

###### Header 6

| head1        | head two          | three |
|:-------------|:------------------|:------|
| ok           | typing speed      | nice  |
| out of stock | inspiration       | nice  |
| ok           | good `theme`      | hmm   |
| ok           | good `snacks`     | yumm  |

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Handah</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1852</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Occupation</dt>
<dd>Protagonist</dd>
</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

```
The final element.
